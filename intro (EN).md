# Introduction

The establishment of this Github organization initially stemmed from the development of a wiki-like website called "[Takagi Wiki Site](https://wiki.takagi3.cn)". Being under the same organization would make it more convenient to coordinate efforts, rather than having multiple individual accounts.

However, due to the limited number of contributors, progress in content development was slow. Considering the possibility of open sourcing, in case enthusiastic friends were willing to help, this Github organization was created as a means of consolidation based on a suggestion from another friend. Its original name was "TakagiWikiSitesCN".

Later, upon searching on Github, it was discovered that there were actually several repositories related to Takagi, some of which were familiar names seen in various group chats. The idea arose to create a large open organization where all content related to Takagi could be integrated, forming a "specialized content" repository organization. As a result, the name was changed to "TakagisanArchiveRepos".

2023.7.27: Finalized name - "TakagisanReposOrg"

For friends who come across this, it is hoped that they can participate and contribute to the overall technical empowerment of the Takagi community.
